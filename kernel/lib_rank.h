 *	       // usually you need at least 1 call for each rkd[] element,

 *	       // from many different sources.
 *	       // Note: instead / additionally, you may also use
 *	       // ranking_add() or ranking_override().
 *     }
 *     ranking_stop(...);
 *
 * => now the new ranking values are computed and already active
 * for the round-robin ranking_select() mechanism described below.
 *
 * Important: the rki[] array describes a ranking function at some
 * example points (x_i,y_i) which must be ordered according to x_i
 * in ascending order. And, of course, you need to supply at least
 * two sample points (otherwise a linear function cannot
 * be described).
 * The array _must_ always end with a dummy record where the x_i has the
 * value RKI_DUMMY.
